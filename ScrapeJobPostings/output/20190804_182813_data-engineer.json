Our team has exploded from 4 to 60+. We're looking to add more smart people who want to contribute meaningfully. \r\nOfferZen was founded by Philip and Malan Joubert, along with other successful tech startups like SnapScan ( http://www.snapscan.co.za/ ), JourneyApps ( https://www.journeyapps.com/ ) and Luno ( https://www.luno.com/ ). \r\nOur mission is to improve the experience of finding work for makers – people involved in making software, from developers to designers and data scientists.

We are transparent with our numbers and strategy and have weekly learning sessions where someone in the company presents something they do. We get lunch every day and have 20 days of leave a year. We do fun stuff together like going on picnics at Kirstenbosch, playing board games and having Sumo wrestling events! \r\n\r\n About OfferZen \r\nWe're helping makers – the people who design and build software products – to unlock their individual potential. We started with recruitment because helping someone find a job they love is one of the fastest ways of changing their life.

The data scientist, on the other hand, is someone who cleans, massages, and organizes (big) data. You might find the choice of the verb \"massage\" particularly exotic, but it only reflects the difference between data engineers and data scientists even more. Generally speaking, the efforts that both parties will need to do to get the data in a usable format is considerably different. Data engineers deal with raw data that contains human, machine or instrument errors. The data might not be validated and contain suspect records; It will be unformatted and can contain codes that are system-specific. The data engineers will need to recommend and sometimes implement ways to improve data reliability, efficiency, and quality. To do so, they will need to employ a variety of languages and tools to marry systems together or try to hunt down opportunities to acquire new data from other systems so that the system-specific codes, for example, can become information in further processing by data scientists. Very closely related to these two is the fact that data engineers will need to ensure that the architecture that is in place supports the requirements of the data scientists and the stakeholders, the business. Lastly, to deliver the data to the data science team, the data engineering team will need to develop data set processes for data modeling, mining, and production. Duties Daily basis: Data scientists will usually already get data that has passed a first round of cleaning and manipulation, which they can use to feed to sophisticated analytics programs and machine learning and statistical methods to prepare data for use in predictive and prescriptive modeling. Of course, to build models, they need to do research industry and business questions, and they will need to leverage large volumes of data from internal and external sources to answer business needs. This also sometimes involves exploring and examining data to find hidden patterns. Once data scientists have done the analyses, they will need to present a clear story to the key stakeholders and when the results get accepted, they will need to make sure that the work is automated so that the insights can be delivered to the business stakeholders on a daily, monthly or yearly basis. It is clear that both parties need to work together to wrangle the data and provide insights to business critical decisions. There is a clear overlap in skillsets, but the two are gradually becoming more distinct in the industry: while the data engineer will work with database systems, data API's and tools for ETL purposes, and will be involved in data modeling and setting up data warehouse solutions, the data scientist needs to know about stats, math and machine learning to build predictive models. The data scientist needs to be aware of distributed computing, as he will need to gain access to the data that has been processed by the data engineering team, but he or she'll also need to be able to report to the business stakeholders: a focus on storytelling and visualization is essential. Experience: A candidate for the position will have as at least 3 years of working experience as a database engineering support personnel or a database engineering administrator within a fast-paced a complex business setting. The candidate will also have had experience working with MySQL databases and Microsoft SQL. The candidate must demonstrate experience working with large and complex data sets as well as experience analyzing volumes of data through basic Microsoft Excel functions, for example, macros and pivot tables. A candidate for this position will also have had experience working in internet technologies, for example, SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS. A suitable candidate will also have had experience in the creation and debugging of databases critical to the business’s mission. The candidate will have strong working and conceptual knowledge of building and maintaining physical and logical data models and experience with Tableau, Domo or other business intelligence tools. A suitable candidate for the position will also have had system management expertise with monitoring, disaster recovery, backup, automated testing, automated schema migration, and continuous deployment. \r\n\r\nTo apply immediately for this position click here: http://www.unique.co.za/candidate_registration_1.aspx?JobID=58076&referrer=Unique\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInherent Requirements\r\n\r\nEducation: The Data Engineer must have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, or any other technology related field.
